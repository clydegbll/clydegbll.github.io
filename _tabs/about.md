# Clyde Gabriel Ball

Hello! My name is Clyde Gabriel Ball, and I am a programmer, coach, nerd, athlete, and volunteer. I graduated from Louisiana State University in the spring of '24, and have been based out of Atlanta ever since.

### Programmer

In the fall of 2019, I began my journey to acquire a degree in Computer Science, and I have been passionately honing my craft ever since. My class work concentrated on machine learning, Big Data, data science, and network engineering concepts, and most of my projects reflect this. From creating and querying databases to image recognition, there is a wide scope of projects to be found on my [GitHub.](https://github.com/clydegbll)

### Coach

I am proud to be a coach of the Forsyth County Falcons youth rugby team! Rugby is a sport I played through out high school and college, and coaching has been an amazing experience> If you are interested in finding out more information about the Falcons or youth rugby in general, please checkout their website [here.](https://www.forsythyouthrugby.com/)

### Athlete, Nerd, and More

Outside of my professional and philanthropic endeavors, I have many hobbies and interests. From backpacking, to video games, to sports, and everything in between, I find myself exploring whatever I find interesting. Occasionally, my hobbies intersect with my professional endeavors, and will result in things [like a data science x League of Legends project.](https://github.com/clydegbll/Head2Head) 
As you explore my website, I hope you find things that interest you!
