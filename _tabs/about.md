# Clyde Gabriel Ball

Hello! My name is Clyde Gabriel Ball, and I am a programmer, coach, nerd, athlete, and volunteer. I graduated from Louisiana State University in the Spring of '24, and have been based out of Atlanta ever since.

### Programmer

In the fall of 2019, I began my journey to acquire a degree in Computer Science, and I have been passionately honing my craft ever since. My class work concentrated on machine learning, Big Data, data science, and network engineering concepts, and most of my projects reflect this. From creating and querying databases to image recognition, there is a wide scope of projects to be found on my [GitHub.](https://github.com/clydegbll)
